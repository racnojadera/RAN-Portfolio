1. Set up a virtual environment (use venv, notes are googleable) before touching this code
2. Afterwards, run the following command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. You can now contribute to the project. Make sure to follow proper git etiquette (make a new branch for every new freature and commit every discrete change)

Quick notes on Django
1. In the folder "JustDoIt/JustDoIt/JustDoIt", webpages go in the "templates" folder. We'll worry about connecting them later
2. DB work invovles the models.py file and some use of the settings.py file
3. When designing the UI, place an HTML file in the templates folder and test using your preferred web browser. Do NOT touch the rest of the django components.

Run the server using the command 'python manage.py runserver'

URLs so far:
Home page - localhost:8000/homepage/
Notes - localhost:8000/notes/
Notes (ver 2) - localhost:8000/notes2/
Spotify - localhost:8000/spotify/

For testing purposes, you may access the Django admin page (localhost:8000/admin) using the following credentials:
Username: admin
Password: p4ssw0rd

NOTE: In order to use the photo gallery, you need to install Pillow v8.1.2 from pip. Please run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' again to install this version.
