What the frick did you just fricking say
about me, you little female dog? I’ll have
you know I graduated top of my class in the
Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in 
numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I
have over 300 confirmed game ends. I am
trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top
sniper in the entire US armed forces. You
are nothing to me but just another target.
I will wipe you the frick out with
precision the likes of which has never
been seen before on this Earth, mark my
fricking words. You think you can get away
with saying that poop to me over the
Internet? Think again, fricker. As we
speak I am contacting my secret network
of spies across the USA and your IP is
being traced right now so you better
prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm
that wipes out the pathetic little thing
you call your life. You’re fricking game
ended, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime,
and I can game end you in over seven
hundred ways, and that’s just with my
bare hands. Not only am I extensively
trained in unarmed combat, but I have
access to the entire arsenal of the
United States Marine Corps and I will
use it to its full extent to wipe your
miserable buttox off the face of the
continent, you little poop. If only you
could have known what unholy retribution
your little “clever” comment was about to
bring down upon you, maybe you would have
held your fricking tongue. But you couldn’t,
you didn’t, and now you’re paying the
price, you goddamn S T U P I D D U M B
D U M B. I will poop fury all over you and
you will drown in it. You’re fricking game
ended, kiddo.
